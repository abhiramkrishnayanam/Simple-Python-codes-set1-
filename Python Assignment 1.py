# Exercise 1 Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address.
# An example runs of the program: Bob ST1001 bob@gmail.com
# name = str(input("enter your name "))
# email = str(input("enter your mail id "))
# stdnum = str(input("enter your student number in the course "))
# print (f"Your name is {name} ")
# print (f"Your email id is {email} ")
# print (f"Your Student number is {stdnum} ")

# Exercise 2 Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address using escape sequences.
# name = str(input("enter your name "))
# email = str(input("enter your mail id "))
# stdnum = str(input("enter your student number in the course "))
# #used \n as escape sequence
# print (f"Your name is {name}\nYour email id is {email}\nYour Student number is {stdnum}")

# Exercise 3 Write Python code that add, subtract, multiply and divide the two numbers.
# You can use the two numbers 14 and 7.
# x=14
# y=7
# print(f"sum of the numbers is {x+y}\ndifference of the numbers is {x-y}"
#       f"\nproduct of the numbers is {x*y}\nquotient when x is divided by y is {int(x/y)}")

# Exercise 4 Write Python code that displays the numbers from 1 to 5 as steps.
# for i in range (1,6):
#     print(i)

# Exercise 5 Write Python code that outputs the following sentence (including the quotation
# marks and line break) to the screen: An example runs of the program: "SDK" stands for
# "Software Development Kit", whereas "IDE" stands for "Integrated Development Environment".
# print("\"SDK\" stands for \"Software Development Kit\","
#       "\nwhereas \"IDE\" stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\". ")

# Exercise 6 Practice and check the output
# print("python is an \"awesome\" language.")
# print("python\n\t2023")
# print('I\'m from Entri.\b')
# print("\65")
# print("\x65")
# print("\"Entri\", \"2023\", sep=\n")
# print("\"Entri\", \"2023\", sep=\b")
# print("\"Entri\", \"2023\", sep=\"*\", end=\b\b\b\b")

# Exercise 7 Define the variables below. Print the types of each variable.
# What is the sum of your variables? (Hint: use a type conversion function.)
# What datatype is the sum? num=23 textnum="57" decimal=98.3
# num=23
# textnum="57"
# decimal=98.3
# print(f"data type of num is {type(num)}\ndata type of textnum is {type(textnum)}"
#       f"\ndata type of decimal is {type(decimal)}")
# sum=float(23+float(textnum)+decimal)
# print (f"the sum of num,textnum and decimal is {sum} with datatype {type(sum)}. ")

# Exercise 8 calculate the number of minutes in a year using variables for each unit of time.
# print a statement that describes what your code does also.
# Create three variables to store no of days in a year, minute in a hour, hours in a day,
# then calculate the total minutes in a year and print the values (hint) total number of
# minutes in an year =No.of days in an year * Hours in a day * Minutes in an hour.

# min_in_hour = 60#number of minutes in an hour
# hours_in_day =24
# days_in_year=365
# mins_in_year = days_in_year * hours_in_day * min_in_hour
# print("Here in a hour there are 60 minutes and in a day 24 hours ,then in an year 365 days so")
# print(f"the total number of minutes in an year is {mins_in_year}.")

# Exercise 9 Write Python code that asks the user to enter his/her name and then
# output/prints his/her name with a greeting.
# An example runs of the program: Please enter you name: Tony Hi Tony, welcome to Python programming :)
# name=input("enter your name ")
# print(f"Hi {name},\n Welcome to the world of programing. ")
